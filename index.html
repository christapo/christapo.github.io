    <p>I am currently pursuing my Master's in applied mathematics at <a href="https://www.uakron.edu/">The University of Akron</a>
        and working as a data analyst at <a href="https://www.amlrightsource.com/">AML RightSource</a>.
        I completed my Bachelor's degree in mathematics at <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a> where I was an intern at
        Dr. Qiyun Zhu's <a href="https://qiyunlab.github.io/">Computational Microbiomics Lab</a>.
        My research interests include computational phylogenetics, combinatorics, and category theory.</p>
    <p>Pictured above is the El Morro Inscription Rock. Formerly inhabited by the Ancestral Puebloans, this location has served
      as a landmark for travelers for centuries featuring a variety of writing systems and petroglyphs.</p>
