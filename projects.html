    <h2>Algorithms for Phylogenetic Inference</h2>
    <p>Topics like community ecology, population biology, and the various -omics see an increasing demand for
    more efficient algorithms for reconstructing a phylogenetic tree as the number of taxa considered in these
    studies grow quite large. For example, microbial communities can often require millions of taxa to be considered.</p>
    <p>I am working on implementing a variety of algorithms, heuristics, and metrics for phylogenetic inference in Python.
    Some of these Python implementations can be found in the bioinformatics package <a href="https://scikit.bio/">Scikit-bio</a>.</p>
    <h2>Phylogenetic Networks and Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>Phylogenetic networks, in contrast to phylogenetic trees, are able to model reticulation events like hybridization
    horizontal gene transfer.</p>
    <p>My research aims to understand the effect that including reticulation events has on measuring phylogenetic biodiversity
    as well as investigating algorithms for reconstructing phylogenetic networks.</p>
    <h2>Polytopes and Categorical Coherence</h2>
    <p>In category theory, especially higher category theory, the equivalence between strict and weak categorical strucutres is
    known as a categorical coherence problem. Equivalently, this is a problem of showing that certain types of diagrams commute.</p>
    <p>Weak n-dimensional categories are defined with associativity conditions that have the shape of Stasheff's family of polytope, the
    associahedra. Similarly, functors between weak n-dimensional categories have functoriality conditions that have the shape of the
    multiplihedra, a related family of polytopes. Some research questions of mine are: If we continue and look at natural transformations
    between weak n-dimensional categories do these conditions also form polytopes? What about modifications, perturbations, and
    <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transfor">k-transfors</a> in general? Can we utilize these polytopes for topological proofs
    of categorical coherence?</p>
    <h2>Cultural Phylogenetics and Rock Art Research</h2>
    <p>Writing systems, spoken languages, and even specific texts have been analyzed using methods from evolutionary
    biology, particularly phylogenetics. Examples of this can be seen in stemmatics from textual criticism to tree models
    used in historical linguistics.</p>
    <p>I am interested in using phylogenetics to analyze the precursors of writing systems, namely petroglyphs and pictographs.
    Some interesting questions: Can a phylogenetic analysis of rock art be used to help us understand the interactions and
    cultural transmission between prehistoric cultural groups? Furthermore, can we interpret and use biodiversity measurements
    in this context?
